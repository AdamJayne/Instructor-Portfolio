                        Growing up in a small town, I always had my hands on a keyboard, even if I wasn't supposed to.
                        With my grandfather's guidance, I helped manage a herd of Angus cattle, even going as far as winning Champion Angus Heifer at my county fair.
                        After giving college a try, and discovering it didn't fit my learning style, I stumbled upon Eleven Fifty Academy through family.
                        12 weeks, and a year and a half of working in the industry later, I came back to the school to become an instructor.
